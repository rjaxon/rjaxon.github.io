<p >What do you want the game to be about? Answer that question.</p>
<p >Create a stat that reflects each of these tendencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflexive/Graceful</li>
<li>Persuasive/Assertive</li>
<li>Aggressive/Forceful</li>
<li>Calculating/Methodical</li>
<li>Inquisitive/Exploratory</li>
</ul>
<p >If one of those tendencies doesn't matter to the story you want to create,<br>
either remove it altogether (thus creating 4 stats) or make up a stat that<br>
reflects something totally different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >Vx wants to use Simple World to play a post-apocalyptic game. He<br>
names his stats Cool (reflexive/graceful), Hot (persuasive/assertive),<br>
Hard (aggressive/forceful), Sharp (calculating/methodical), and Weird<br>
(inquisitive/exploratory).</p>
<p >Courtney wants to use Simple World to play a "unicorn-riding ladies<br>
on a quest"  game. She names her stats Grace (reflexive/graceful),<br>
Charm (persuasive/assertive), Daring (aggressive/forceful), Cunning<br>
(calculating/methodical), and Whim (inquisitive/exploratory).</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Write the Stats onto each player's character sheet.</p>
<p >Take a set of index cards. Write an evocative title on each - a type of<br>
interesting person you'd want to tell stories about. These are the game's<br>
character seeds. Beneath the title, list three specialities they might excel at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >Vx writes Brainer (mind control, echoing the psychic maelstrom,<br>
voyeurism) and Hardholder (controlling lackeys, protecting the<br>
village, bartering up) and Driver (driving cars, acting disinterested,<br>
siege) and Savvyhead (fixing things, breaking things, unlocking the<br>
secrets of the universe)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p >Courtney writes Princess (leading comrades, courage spells, archery)<br>
and Hand-Maiden (supporting comrades, healing spells, subterfuge)<br>
and Witch (vanquishing evil, curses, speaking to ghosts) and Hawk-Caller (siege tactics, recon, merciless choices).</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Next, take a look at your Agenda / Principles / MC Moves.</p>
<p >The Agendas are the reasons you play the game.</p>
<p >The first two are filled in for you. Fill in the third:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the players' characters' lives not boring.</li>
<li>Play to find out what happens.</li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
<p >The Principles are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in<br>
the game. A list is filled in for you, just waiting to be customized. Use this<br>
customization opportunity to establish the way you plan to pace and run<br>
the game.</p>
<p >Cross off up to two of these Principles, and write in up to two of your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle evocative details everywhere.</li>
<li>Make the world seem real.</li>
<li>Build a bigger world through play.</li>
<li>Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.</li>
<li>Address yourself to the characters, not the players.</li>
<li>Make your move, but misdirect.</li>
<li>Make your move, but never speak its name.</li>
<li>Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.</li>
<li>Name everyone, make everyone human.</li>
<li>Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.</li>
<li>Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.</li>
<li>Be a fan of the players' characters.</li>
<li>Think offscreen, too.</li>
<li>Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.</li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
<p >The MC moves are the specific things you say in any moment. There<br>
are two different cases where you use the MC Moves, and you use<br>
them differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you<br>
expectantly, you make a regular MC Move. When a player fails a die<br>
roll (getting 6 or lower), you make a hard MC Move. John Harper best<br>
described how to handle those two cases, so I'll quote him:</p>
<p ><strong>When you make a regular MC move, all three:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It follows logically from the fiction.</li>
<li>It gives the player an opportunity to react.</li>
<li>It sets you up for a future harder move.</li>
</ol>
<p >Say what happens but stop before the effect, then ask "What do you do?"</p>
<p ><strong>When you make a hard MC move, both:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It follows logically from the fiction.</li>
<li>It's irrevocable.</li>
</ol>
<p >Say what happens, including the effect, then ask "What do you do?"</p>
<p >A list of MC Moves is already written for you, waiting to be customized.</p>
<p >Cross off up to three moves, and add up to three of your own to the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate them.</li>
<li>Put them together.</li>
<li>Put someone in a high-stakes situation.</li>
<li>Trade harm for harm (as established).</li>
<li>Deal harm (as established).</li>
<li>Announce off-screen badness.</li>
<li>Announce future badness.</li>
<li>Take away one of their Things.</li>
<li>Demonstrate one of their Things' bad sides.</li>
<li>Give them a difficult decision to make.</li>
<li>Tell them the possible consequences and ask.</li>
<li>Turn their move back on them.</li>
<li>Make a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.</li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p >Vx adds "Erode all status quos"  as his final Agenda. For Principles, he<br>
crosses off "Build a bigger world through play,"  as his vision involves<br>
small communities and very little over-arching social structure. He also<br>
crosses off "Sprinkle evocative details everywhere"  in order to replace<br>
it with the more specific and thematic "Barf forth apocalyptica."  For<br>
the MC Moves, he crosses off "Put them together"  and adds "Capture<br>
someone"  and "Reveal a fundamental scarcity."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p >Courtney adds "Make doing the right thing difficult for the players'<br>
characters'"  as her final Agenda. For Principles, she crosses off "Look at<br>
your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs"  and writes "Allow your NPCs<br>
to change and develop in expected directions" .For MC Moves, she<br>
crosses off "Trade harm for harm (as established)"  and "Deal harm (as<br>
established)" . She adds "Introduce a new barrier to carrying on"  and<br>
"Destroy something precious (as established)" .</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Finally, every PC in the game has a relationship stat with every other<br>
character. You can name this relationship stat something special, or just<br>
call it "Relationships."  When you help someone or hinder them, that has<br>
its own basic move, and you roll your relationship stat.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Helping_and_Hindering_PCs_160"></a>Helping and Hindering PCs</h2>
<p >When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with<br>
that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the MC<br>
will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Helping_and_Hindering_NPCs_166"></a>Helping and Hindering NPCs</h2>
<p >When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with<br>
that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9,<br>
the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail</p>
<ul>
<li>your choice</li>
</ul>
<p >At the start of the game, each player will assign the following relationship<br>
stat scores that their character has toward the other PCs: +2 for the one<br>
they know best, -1 for the one they know least, and +1 for all others. They<br>
will also list "NPCs: 0,"  as the default is that they have a relationship score<br>
with all NPCs that starts at 0.</p>
<p >Relationship scores will go up and down over play. Choose how:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of each session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up<br>
or down by 1.</li>
<li>Whenever two characters have a special scene together, their scores go<br>
up by 1. Whenever two characters work against one another publicly,<br>
their scores go down by 1.</li>
<li>Characters can betray one another for a +2 bonus to a roll, but their<br>
relationship score goes down by 1. Characters can make meaningful<br>
sacrifices for someone, and their relationship score toward that person<br>
will go up by one.</li>
<li>Some other system that you invent:</li>
</ul>
<p >Write the relationship score triggers on each character sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >Vx names his relationship stat Hx. He decides that at the end of each<br>
session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up or down by 1.</p>
<p >Courtney names her relationship stat Friendship. She decides to create<br>
her own system for how relationships go up. Each PC lists a virtue on<br>
their character sheet (Hope, Justice, Bravery, etc). When another PC<br>
exemplifies that virtue, the relationship held toward that PC goes up by</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever another PC contradicts that virtue, the relationship held<br>
toward that PC goes down by 1.</li>
</ol>
<p >Joe is writing a Simple World game about teenage monster drama.<br>
He decides that the relationship stat goes down every time you roll it,<br>
and it goes up every time you gain emotional leverage over a character<br>
(NPCs included!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p >That's it! You've got stats, character seeds, Agendas/Principles/Moves, and<br>
a relationship stat. You're ready to get a group together and play</p>
<h2 ><a id="Creating_Characters_220"></a>Creating Characters</h2>
<p >Hand each player a character sheet. It should have the stat names listed,<br>
including the relationship stat. It should have a description of how the<br>
relationship stat goes up and down over the course of the game.</p>
<p >Place the character concepts in the middle of the table. Talk about what<br>
they might mean and why they might be cool. Have everyone pick one and<br>
fasten it to their character sheet (in the concept box) using a paper clip.</p>
<p >Tell them to assign the following numbers to their 5 basic stats: +2, +1,<br>
+1, 0, -1. If you only have 4 stats, instead assign: +2, +1, 0, -1.</p>
<p >The maximum that a stat can ever reach in the game is +3, and the<br>
minimum is -1. This includes relationship stats. Player moves cannot<br>
advance a stat beyond +3 (though player moves can temporarily or<br>
circumstantially increase it beyond +3).</p>
<p >Each PC has a relationship stat with each other PC. Tell the players to do<br>
this: whichever PC they know the best, write +2 next to that character's<br>
name. Whichever PC they know the least, write -1 next to that character's<br>
name. For each other PC, write +1. Tell them to write "NPCs"  and assign<br>
that relationship a 0.</p>
<p >Every character has a harm clock, with six sections. When characters<br>
take harm in the game, they mark a number of sections equal to whatever<br>
amount of harm the MC tells them they take. Point out the harm clock,<br>
and explain that when it's filled all the way up, the characters are taken out<br>
of the action (in a genre-appropriate way).</p>
<p >The next stage of creating characters is to pick 3 moves. When a player<br>
picks a move, they pick an option from the list below, give the move a title,<br>
and fill in the blanks. Each move gets recorded on their character sheet</p>
<h3 ><a id="Player_Moves_255"></a>Player Moves:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you do something relating to [specialty], add +1.</li>
<li>You have the ability to [do some sort of active special power]. It counts<br>
as a basic move using [stat].</li>
<li>You have [some passive special power that has a constant effect].</li>
<li>You have a [thing]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [stat] and [stat].</li>
<li>When you do [specialty], mark XP.</li>
<li>Add +1 to [stat].</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p >Mark is playing in Vx's apocalyptic game. He chooses Brainer, and<br>
names them Wendigo. He gives Wendigo the stats: Cool -1, Hot 0, Hard<br>
+1, Sharp +1, Weird +2. Their relationship stat is called Hx, and the<br>
other PCs are named Brink and Rolfball. He decides he has Hx 2 with<br>
Blink, and Hx -1 with Rolfball. He creates the following three moves:</p>
<p >Dirty Secrets: You have the ability to detect someone's secret shame. It<br>
counts as a basic move using Weird.</p>
<p >Mind Strings: When you do something relating to mind control, add +1.</p>
<p >Open Your Brain: When you echo the psychic maelstrom, mark XP.</p>
<p >Lane is playing in Courtney's unicorn knights game. He chooses<br>
Princess, and names his character Lucinda. He gives Lucinda the stats:<br>
Grace +1, Charm +2, Daring 0, Cunning +1, and Whim -1. Their<br>
relationship stat is tied to a virtue, and Lane chooses Courage. He<br>
decides Lucinda knows Mercury the best, and writes "Mercury +2."  He<br>
decides he knows Helena the least, and so has a Relationship of -1 with<br>
Helena. That leaves Ophelia, who Lucinda has a +1 relationship with<br>
by default. Lucinda is given the following three player moves:</p>
<p >Fearless: When you do something related to leading comrades, add +1.</p>
<p >Sharpshooter: When you do something related to archery, add +1.</p>
<p >Horn of Ancestral Power: You have a Horn of Ancestral Power. When<br>
applicable, it adds +1 to Charm</p>
</blockquote>
<p >Finally, each PC is going to have two stats highlighted. Have each player<br>
(except the MC) choose and highlight a stat for the PC to their left. Then<br>
have the MC highlight a second stat.</p>
<p >When you highlight a stat, you fill in the bubble next to the stat. When a<br>
PC rolls a highlighted stat, they gain a point of XP (experience).</p>
<h2 ><a id="Playing_the_Game_308"></a>Playing the Game</h2>
<h3 ><a id="MCing_the_Game_310"></a>MCing the Game</h3>
<p >Early in the first session, the MC should juggle two responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the PCs around, and learn what they're all about.</li>
<li>Give the players a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.</li>
</ul>
<p >Astute players will realize that these two things can sometimes be at<br>
odds with one another. MC, the way you navigate this combination of<br>
responsibilities is by honouring your Agendas and your Principles.</p>
<h3 ><a id="Talking_and_Moves_321"></a>Talking and Moves</h3>
<p >The game is like a conversation. People describe what their characters do,<br>
ask questions about what's going on, and talk in character. If someone<br>
says something that seems untrue or unreasonable, the MC is allowed to<br>
say, "I don't think that's possible, but you could instead [make some other<br>
interesting choice], if you'd like."</p>
<p >At some point, the MC will determine that something requires a roll.<br>
Actions require a roll when they are opposed by other characters or run<br>
the risk of interesting failure. When one of these conditions is met, the<br>
player needs to roll for a basic move. The MC will name which stat applies<br>
to the situation. The player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their stat to<br>
the sum. The effects depend on the basic move in question.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Basic_Moves_336"></a>Basic Moves</h2>
<p >There are three basic moves.</p>
<h3 ><a id="Taking_Action_340"></a>Taking Action</h3>
<p >When you take an action that risks failure or opposition, roll with one of<br>
the basic stats. On a 10+, you succeed at your goal. As appropriate, the<br>
MC might award you: resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry<br>
forward. On a 7-9, the MC will offer you a hard bargain or a cost. If<br>
you agree to that hard bargain or cost, you succeed at your goal (and as<br>
appropriate, the MC might award you resource points, harm dealt, or a<br>
bonus to carry forward).</p>
<h3 ><a id="Helping_and_Hindering_PCs_350"></a>Helping and Hindering PCs</h3>
<p >When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with<br>
that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the MC<br>
will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.</p>
<h3 ><a id="Helping_and_Hindering_NPCs_356"></a>Helping and Hindering NPCs</h3>
<p >When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with<br>
that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9,<br>
the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail</p>
<ul>
<li>your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p >When you roll 6 or lower on a Basic Move, the MC gets to make a hard<br>
MC Move.</p>
<p >Moves (both the Basic Moves and the MC Moves) should continually<br>
propel the game forward in interesting ways. When a player succeeds<br>
on a Basic Move, their success should be interesting and introduce new<br>
opportunities for them. When a player gets a 7-9 on a Basic Move, the<br>
dilemma and hard bargain should create compelling drama, and either<br>
choice should be interesting and take the story in new directions. When a<br>
player fails on a Basic Move, the MC should respond with a hard MC Move<br>
that fundamentally changes the situation and demands new kinds of action.</p>
<p >Whenever people look at the MC expectantly, the MC should make a<br>
regular MC Move. This should create new things for the players to react<br>
to. The MC should then go on to say, "So, what do you do?"</p>
<h2 ><a id="Resource_Points_380"></a>Resource Points</h2>
<p >When someone succeeds (with a 10+ or a 7-9) on a Taking Action roll,<br>
it'll sometimes make sense to represent their success with a number of<br>
resource points. For example, if someone tries to read a person's facial<br>
expressions and determine their true intent in a conversation, they<br>
might make a roll. If they get a 10+, the MC might determine that they<br>
have 3 conversation points, and they can spend those points 1-for-1<br>
to get answers about the character's motivations and goals during the<br>
conversation. Resource points are always given a name and function<br>
at the time they are awarded. In most cases, resource points should be<br>
temporary, lasting until the end of a scene or situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >In Vx's game, Wendigo (the Brainer) decides to try to mind control<br>
a wandering merchant to just hand over his choice goods. The MC<br>
says, "Well, that sounds like Taking Action, because the merchant<br>
is obviously opposed to such an attempt. Weird applies here, right?"<br>
Wendigo's Weird stat is 2, and he's got that move Mind Strings (When<br>
you do something relating to mind control, add +1). He rolls a 2 and<br>
a 5, and adds it to the +3 from his stat &amp; move. A 10! The MC says,<br>
"Alright, you've got two mind control points. You can spend them 1-for-1<br>
to force him to either obey a psychic command or suffer 1 harm."</p>
<p >In Courtney's game, Lucinda (the Princess) decides to lead her fellow<br>
unicorn knights on a charge into the ogre's keep! She's unfortunately got<br>
a Daring of 0, but she has a move that applies: Fearless (When you do<br>
something related to [leading comrades], add +1). She rolls a total of 7.<br>
The MC says, "Alright, here's your hard bargain: as you're charging in,<br>
the ogre sentries ready their spiked clubs. You can press forward, but<br>
your unicorn will be wounded and require care."  Lucinda agrees, and<br>
the MC says, "Alright, I'm going to award you three tactics points. You<br>
can spend them to do stuff like: round up the sentries, ensure no ogres<br>
escape, ensure no one else gets wounded, avoid being smoked out or<br>
driven back, ask questions about the situation, and so on."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 ><a id="Dealing_Harm_415"></a>Dealing Harm</h2>
<p >When someone succeeds on a Taking Action roll, it'll sometimes make<br>
sense that they would deal harm to their opposition. Harm is typically<br>
physical harm that's brought about by violence, but it may vary from<br>
setting to setting. When someone does harm to someone else, the MC<br>
will rate that harm from 1-3. What qualifies as a certain score will vary<br>
from setting to setting. PC harm gets marked down on the harm clock<br>
on their character sheet. NPC harm gets noted by the MC, either in their<br>
head or on a notes page. NPCs can typically take 2 harm before they're<br>
taken out of the action, but tougher NPCs might have more.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Being_Taken_Out_of_Action_427"></a>Being Taken Out of Action</h2>
<p >When a character has all of their harm sections filled in, they're taken<br>
out of the action. The specifics will vary based on genre and context. In<br>
a Hardy Boys game, being taken out of the action means disappearing<br>
under mysterious circumstances (to wake up tied to a chair later) or<br>
being put into a coma. In an apocalyptic gang fighting game, being taken<br>
out of the action means being killed. When a character is taken out of<br>
the action, they're no longer playable - either they're dead or they're the<br>
functional equivalent of being dead. If the character was a PC, the player<br>
should create a new character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >In Vx's game, Brink (the Driver) decides to run over a thug who's trying<br>
to guard the road. He rolls Hard, and gets a 10. The MC says, "Great.<br>
You definitely hit this guy and hear a thump underneath the car. A car<br>
going at this speed is definitely worth 2 harm, so he's either dead or<br>
near death. The road's clear. What do you do next?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 ><a id="Bonus_to_Carry_Forward_448"></a>Bonus to Carry Forward</h2>
<p >Sometimes, succeeding on a Taking Action roll means that the PC is set<br>
up for future successes. In these cases, the MC can award a +1 bonus that<br>
the PC can apply to their next roll. The player should mark that bonus on<br>
their character sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >In Courtney's game, Helena (the Hawk Caller) sends her hawks out to<br>
scout for the best place to try to sneak across the fortress walls. That's<br>
a Taking Action roll, and Helena gets a 7-9. The MC says, "Alright,<br>
your hawks sweep over the fortress, but they draw the suspicions of the<br>
guards. If you press forward, you'll be encountering guards who are<br>
armed and ready for you. But the hawks do identify the best place for<br>
you to try to scale the walls - down by the thicket, where the wall has<br>
begun to crumble. You'll carry a +1 bonus forward to scaling the wall<br>
there, if you choose to."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 ><a id="Marking_XP_465"></a>Marking XP</h2>
<p >Whenever you roll a highlighted stat you earn a point of XP. Mark it on<br>
the XP section of your sheet. When you hit 5 XP, erase all of it and take a<br>
new Player Move. If you've already got at least one move that references<br>
each of your specialities, you may create a new specialty and reference it<br>
in the Player Move you purchase.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Between_Sessions_473"></a>Between Sessions</h2>
<p >At the end of each session, players may be asked to adjust relationship<br>
stats (if that's how relationship stats fluctuate in your game). Between<br>
sessions, the MC might create Dangers, and might link those Dangers<br>
into Bigger Pictures. At the start of each session, highlighted stats are<br>
changed. Whoever has the highest relationship score with a character<br>
chooses a stat to highlight, and the MC highlights a second stat.</p>
<h2 ><a id="Dangers__the_Bigger_Picture_482"></a>Dangers &amp; the Bigger Picture</h2>
<p >Between sessions, or even during them, the MC can create Dangers.<br>
Dangers are things that might cause problems for the PCs, or fight them<br>
for resources, or block the PCs on their path. When you create a Danger,<br>
take an index card. Write its name, and its Ambition, and 1-3 MC Moves.<br>
Its Ambition is whatever this thing wants and strives for. If the PCs don't<br>
do anything about the Danger, the Ambition will either happen or it'll be<br>
attempted and disastrous effects will result. The MC Moves are things that<br>
the MC can add to their list of MC Moves whenever the Danger is afoot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >In Vx's post-apocalyptic game, he creates a Danger called "Morken, the<br>
Grotesque."  His Ambition is "Hoard all valuables in the rag wastes."  His<br>
MC Moves are "Display the nature of the world it inhabits. Threaten<br>
someone, directly or by implication. Steal something from someone."<br>
Whenever Morken is in the scene, those three things are things that Vx<br>
can do as MC Moves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p >In Courtney's unicorn knights game, she creates a Danger called "The<br>
Swamps of Symmetry."  Its Ambition is "Eliminate all odd numbers and<br>
out-of-balance things."  Its MC Moves are "Corral people into a remote<br>
location. Obscure the way out. Attempt to swallow people alive."</p>
<p >If you have a group of Dangers that work together or interlock, you<br>
can group them together into a Bigger Picture. Take an index card<br>
and fold it in half. Now it acts as a folder or hand that you can stick<br>
the related Dangers into. On the front of the folded index card, list the<br>
Bigger Picture's name. On the inside halves, list a new Principle and a<br>
Dark Future. The Principle is something that you should do whenever<br>
this Bigger Picture is involved in a scene. The Dark Future is a list of<br>
possibilities for what could happen if the PCs don't intervene and change<br>
this Bigger Picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p >Vx decides that Morken isn't the only threat in the Rag Wastes. So<br>
he creates a new Bigger Picture called "The Rag Wastes."  In it,<br>
Vx sticks three interrelated Dangers: Morken the Grotesque; The Gang<br>
of Thunder; Rag Wurms. He lists a new Principle for whenever the<br>
PCs are interacting with the Rag Wastes: "Entice people with<br>
dangerous opportunities."  As the Dark Future, Vx writes "The Rag<br>
Wastes will expand, becoming a dangerous and impassible realm of<br>
thieves and mutants."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 ><a id="Genre_and_MC_Decisions_527"></a>Genre and MC Decisions</h2>
<p >The MC will have to make a number of decisions before and during play.<br>
The MC Prep that comes before play (naming stats, modifying Agendas/<br>
Principles/MC Moves, clarifying the relationship stat) involves a lot of<br>
decisions about genre and tone. More decisions along these lines will be<br>
made in play.</p>
<p >The MC will have to make judgment calls about what requires a Taking<br>
Action roll, and what is outright impossible in the genre. The MC should<br>
use their veto right judiciously and sparingly. If someone wants to take<br>
an action that subverts the genre, that's good! It's only when they want to<br>
take an action that is impossible or nonsensical for a given genre that the<br>
MC should say that something isn't possible. When the MC says this, they<br>
should use the line, "I don't think that's possible, but you could instead<br>
[make some other interesting choice], if you'd like."</p>
<p >When someone has all of the sections on their harm clock filled in, they<br>
are taken out of the action. What this means is dependent on genre and<br>
context. In a fighting adventure game, this will typically mean that they<br>
are killed or captured by fierce antagonistic forces. The MC should not<br>
pull their punches when they take someone out of the action! It should be<br>
done in the most dramatic and severe and permanent manner that makes<br>
sense for the genre and context.</p>
