## MC Prep

What do you want the game to be about? Answer that question.

Create a stat that reflects each of these tendencies:

-	 Reflexive/Graceful
-	 Persuasive/Assertive
-	 Aggressive/Forceful
-	 Calculating/Methodical
-	 Inquisitive/Exploratory

If one of those tendencies doesn't matter to the story you want to create, 
either remove it altogether (thus creating 4 stats) or make up a stat that 
reflects something totally different.

>  Vx wants to use Simple World to play a post-apocalyptic game. He 
>  names his stats Cool (reflexive/graceful), Hot (persuasive/assertive), 
>  Hard (aggressive/forceful), Sharp (calculating/methodical), and Weird 
>  (inquisitive/exploratory).
>  
>  Courtney wants to use Simple World to play a "unicorn-riding ladies 
>  on a quest"  game. She names her stats Grace (reflexive/graceful), 
>  Charm (persuasive/assertive), Daring (aggressive/forceful), Cunning 
>  (calculating/methodical), and Whim (inquisitive/exploratory).

Write the Stats onto each player's character sheet.

Take a set of index cards. Write an evocative title on each - a type of 
interesting person you'd want to tell stories about. These are the game's 
character seeds. Beneath the title, list three specialities they might excel at.

>  Vx writes Brainer (mind control, echoing the psychic maelstrom, 
>  voyeurism) and Hardholder (controlling lackeys, protecting the 
>  village, bartering up) and Driver (driving cars, acting disinterested, 
>  siege) and Savvyhead (fixing things, breaking things, unlocking the 
>  secrets of the universe)


>  Courtney writes Princess (leading comrades, courage spells, archery) 
>  and Hand-Maiden (supporting comrades, healing spells, subterfuge) 
>  and Witch (vanquishing evil, curses, speaking to ghosts) and Hawk-Caller (siege tactics, recon, merciless choices).

Next, take a look at your Agenda / Principles / MC Moves.

The Agendas are the reasons you play the game. 

The first two are filled in for you. Fill in the third:

-	 Make the players' characters' lives not boring.
-	 Play to find out what happens.
-	 &nbsp;

The Principles are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in 
the game. A list is filled in for you, just waiting to be customized. Use this 
customization opportunity to establish the way you plan to pace and run 
the game. 

Cross off up to two of these Principles, and write in up to two of your own:

-	 Sprinkle evocative details everywhere.
-	 Make the world seem real.
-	 Build a bigger world through play.
-	 Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
-	 Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
-	 Make your move, but misdirect.
-	 Make your move, but never speak its name.
-	 Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.
-	 Name everyone, make everyone human.
-	 Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
-	 Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
-	 Be a fan of the players' characters.
-	 Think offscreen, too.
-	 Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.
-	 &nbsp;
-	 &nbsp;
 


The MC moves are the specific things you say in any moment. There 
are two different cases where you use the MC Moves, and you use 
them differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you 
expectantly, you make a regular MC Move. When a player fails a die 
roll (getting 6 or lower), you make a hard MC Move. John Harper best 
described how to handle those two cases, so I'll quote him:

**When you make a regular MC move, all three:**

 1. It follows logically from the fiction.
 2. It gives the player an opportunity to react.
 3. It sets you up for a future harder move.

Say what happens but stop before the effect, then ask "What do you do?" 

**When you make a hard MC move, both:**

 1. It follows logically from the fiction.
 2. It's irrevocable.

Say what happens, including the effect, then ask "What do you do?" 

A list of MC Moves is already written for you, waiting to be customized. 

Cross off up to three moves, and add up to three of your own to the list:

-	 Separate them.
-	 Put them together.
-	 Put someone in a high-stakes situation.
-	 Trade harm for harm (as established).
-	 Deal harm (as established).
-	 Announce off-screen badness.
-	 Announce future badness.
-	 Take away one of their Things.
-	 Demonstrate one of their Things' bad sides.
-	 Give them a difficult decision to make.
-	 Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
-	 Turn their move back on them.
-	 Make a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.

> crosses off "Build a bigger world through play,"  as his vision involves

Finally, every PC in the game has a relationship stat with every other 
character. You can name this relationship stat something special, or just 
call it "Relationships."  When you help someone or hinder them, that has 
its own basic move, and you roll your relationship stat.

## Helping and Hindering PCs

When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with 
that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the MC 
will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.

## Helping and Hindering NPCs

When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with 
that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9, 
the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail 
- your choice






At the start of the game, each player will assign the following relationship 
stat scores that their character has toward the other PCs: +2 for the one 
they know best, -1 for the one they know least, and +1 for all others. They 
will also list "NPCs: 0,"  as the default is that they have a relationship score 
with all NPCs that starts at 0.

Relationship scores will go up and down over play. Choose how:

-	 At the end of each session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up 
or down by 1.
-	 Whenever two characters have a special scene together, their scores go 
up by 1. Whenever two characters work against one another publicly, 
their scores go down by 1.
-	 Characters can betray one another for a +2 bonus to a roll, but their 
relationship score goes down by 1. Characters can make meaningful 
sacrifices for someone, and their relationship score toward that person 
will go up by one.
-	 Some other system that you invent:

Write the relationship score triggers on each character sheet.

> Vx names his relationship stat Hx. He decides that at the end of each 
> session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up or down by 1.
> 
> Courtney names her relationship stat Friendship. She decides to create 
> her own system for how relationships go up. Each PC lists a virtue on 
> their character sheet (Hope, Justice, Bravery, etc). When another PC 
> exemplifies that virtue, the relationship held toward that PC goes up by 
> 1. Whenever another PC contradicts that virtue, the relationship held 
> toward that PC goes down by 1.
> 
> Joe is writing a Simple World game about teenage monster drama. 
> He decides that the relationship stat goes down every time you roll it, 
> and it goes up every time you gain emotional leverage over a character 
> (NPCs included!).

That's it! You've got stats, character seeds, Agendas/Principles/Moves, and 
a relationship stat. You're ready to get a group together and play




## Creating Characters

Hand each player a character sheet. It should have the stat names listed, 
including the relationship stat. It should have a description of how the 
relationship stat goes up and down over the course of the game.

Place the character concepts in the middle of the table. Talk about what 
they might mean and why they might be cool. Have everyone pick one and 
fasten it to their character sheet (in the concept box) using a paper clip.

Tell them to assign the following numbers to their 5 basic stats: +2, +1, 
+1, 0, -1. If you only have 4 stats, instead assign: +2, +1, 0, -1.

The maximum that a stat can ever reach in the game is +3, and the 
minimum is -1. This includes relationship stats. Player moves cannot 
advance a stat beyond +3 (though player moves can temporarily or 
circumstantially increase it beyond +3).

Each PC has a relationship stat with each other PC. Tell the players to do 
this: whichever PC they know the best, write +2 next to that character's 
name. Whichever PC they know the least, write -1 next to that character's 
name. For each other PC, write +1. Tell them to write "NPCs"  and assign 
that relationship a 0.

Every character has a harm clock, with six sections. When characters 
take harm in the game, they mark a number of sections equal to whatever 
amount of harm the MC tells them they take. Point out the harm clock, 
and explain that when it's filled all the way up, the characters are taken out 
of the action (in a genre-appropriate way).

The next stage of creating characters is to pick 3 moves. When a player 
picks a move, they pick an option from the list below, give the move a title, 
and fill in the blanks. Each move gets recorded on their character sheet


### Player Moves:
-	 When you do something relating to [specialty], add +1.
-	 You have the ability to [do some sort of active special power]. It counts 
as a basic move using [stat].
-	 You have [some passive special power that has a constant effect].
-	 You have a [thing]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [stat] and [stat].
-	 When you do [specialty], mark XP.
-	 Add +1 to [stat].

> Mark is playing in Vx's apocalyptic game. He chooses Brainer, and 
> names them Wendigo. He gives Wendigo the stats: Cool -1, Hot 0, Hard 
> +1, Sharp +1, Weird +2. Their relationship stat is called Hx, and the 
> other PCs are named Brink and Rolfball. He decides he has Hx 2 with 
> Blink, and Hx -1 with Rolfball. He creates the following three moves:
> 
> Dirty Secrets: You have the ability to detect someone's secret shame. It 
> counts as a basic move using Weird.
> 
> Mind Strings: When you do something relating to mind control, add +1.
> 
> Open Your Brain: When you echo the psychic maelstrom, mark XP.
> 
> Lane is playing in Courtney's unicorn knights game. He chooses 
> Princess, and names his character Lucinda. He gives Lucinda the stats: 
> Grace +1, Charm +2, Daring 0, Cunning +1, and Whim -1. Their 
> relationship stat is tied to a virtue, and Lane chooses Courage. He 
> decides Lucinda knows Mercury the best, and writes "Mercury +2."  He 
> decides he knows Helena the least, and so has a Relationship of -1 with 
> Helena. That leaves Ophelia, who Lucinda has a +1 relationship with 
> by default. Lucinda is given the following three player moves:
> 
> Fearless: When you do something related to leading comrades, add +1.
> 
> Sharpshooter: When you do something related to archery, add +1.
> 
> Horn of Ancestral Power: You have a Horn of Ancestral Power. When 
> applicable, it adds +1 to Charm


Finally, each PC is going to have two stats highlighted. Have each player 
(except the MC) choose and highlight a stat for the PC to their left. Then 
have the MC highlight a second stat.

When you highlight a stat, you fill in the bubble next to the stat. When a 
PC rolls a highlighted stat, they gain a point of XP (experience).








## Playing the Game

### MCing the Game

Early in the first session, the MC should juggle two responsibilities:

-	 Follow the PCs around, and learn what they're all about.
-	 Give the players a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.

Astute players will realize that these two things can sometimes be at 
odds with one another. MC, the way you navigate this combination of 
responsibilities is by honouring your Agendas and your Principles.

### Talking and Moves

The game is like a conversation. People describe what their characters do, 
ask questions about what's going on, and talk in character. If someone 
says something that seems untrue or unreasonable, the MC is allowed to 
say, "I don't think that's possible, but you could instead [make some other 
interesting choice], if you'd like." 

At some point, the MC will determine that something requires a roll. 
Actions require a roll when they are opposed by other characters or run 
the risk of interesting failure. When one of these conditions is met, the 
player needs to roll for a basic move. The MC will name which stat applies 
to the situation. The player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their stat to 
the sum. The effects depend on the basic move in question.

## Basic Moves

There are three basic moves.

### Taking Action

When you take an action that risks failure or opposition, roll with one of 
the basic stats. On a 10+, you succeed at your goal. As appropriate, the 
MC might award you: resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry 
forward. On a 7-9, the MC will offer you a hard bargain or a cost. If 
you agree to that hard bargain or cost, you succeed at your goal (and as 
appropriate, the MC might award you resource points, harm dealt, or a 
bonus to carry forward).

### Helping and Hindering PCs

When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with 
that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the MC 
will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.

### Helping and Hindering NPCs

When you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with 
that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9, 
the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail 
- your choice.

When you roll 6 or lower on a Basic Move, the MC gets to make a hard 
MC Move.


Moves (both the Basic Moves and the MC Moves) should continually 
propel the game forward in interesting ways. When a player succeeds 
on a Basic Move, their success should be interesting and introduce new 
opportunities for them. When a player gets a 7-9 on a Basic Move, the 
dilemma and hard bargain should create compelling drama, and either 
choice should be interesting and take the story in new directions. When a 
player fails on a Basic Move, the MC should respond with a hard MC Move 
that fundamentally changes the situation and demands new kinds of action.

Whenever people look at the MC expectantly, the MC should make a 
regular MC Move. This should create new things for the players to react 
to. The MC should then go on to say, "So, what do you do?" 

## Resource Points

When someone succeeds (with a 10+ or a 7-9) on a Taking Action roll, 
it'll sometimes make sense to represent their success with a number of 
resource points. For example, if someone tries to read a person's facial 
expressions and determine their true intent in a conversation, they 
might make a roll. If they get a 10+, the MC might determine that they 
have 3 conversation points, and they can spend those points 1-for-1 
to get answers about the character's motivations and goals during the 
conversation. Resource points are always given a name and function 
at the time they are awarded. In most cases, resource points should be 
temporary, lasting until the end of a scene or situation.

> In Vx's game, Wendigo (the Brainer) decides to try to mind control 
> a wandering merchant to just hand over his choice goods. The MC 
> says, "Well, that sounds like Taking Action, because the merchant 
> is obviously opposed to such an attempt. Weird applies here, right?"  
> Wendigo's Weird stat is 2, and he's got that move Mind Strings (When 
> you do something relating to mind control, add +1). He rolls a 2 and 
> a 5, and adds it to the +3 from his stat & move. A 10! The MC says, 
> "Alright, you've got two mind control points. You can spend them 1-for-1
> to force him to either obey a psychic command or suffer 1 harm." 
> 
> In Courtney's game, Lucinda (the Princess) decides to lead her fellow 
> unicorn knights on a charge into the ogre's keep! She's unfortunately got 
> a Daring of 0, but she has a move that applies: Fearless (When you do 
> something related to [leading comrades], add +1). She rolls a total of 7. 
> The MC says, "Alright, here's your hard bargain: as you're charging in, 
> the ogre sentries ready their spiked clubs. You can press forward, but 
> your unicorn will be wounded and require care."  Lucinda agrees, and 
> the MC says, "Alright, I'm going to award you three tactics points. You 
> can spend them to do stuff like: round up the sentries, ensure no ogres 
> escape, ensure no one else gets wounded, avoid being smoked out or 
> driven back, ask questions about the situation, and so on." 

## Dealing Harm

When someone succeeds on a Taking Action roll, it'll sometimes make 
sense that they would deal harm to their opposition. Harm is typically 
physical harm that's brought about by violence, but it may vary from 
setting to setting. When someone does harm to someone else, the MC 
will rate that harm from 1-3. What qualifies as a certain score will vary 
from setting to setting. PC harm gets marked down on the harm clock 
on their character sheet. NPC harm gets noted by the MC, either in their 
head or on a notes page. NPCs can typically take 2 harm before they're 
taken out of the action, but tougher NPCs might have more.

## Being Taken Out of Action

When a character has all of their harm sections filled in, they're taken 
out of the action. The specifics will vary based on genre and context. In 
a Hardy Boys game, being taken out of the action means disappearing 
under mysterious circumstances (to wake up tied to a chair later) or 
being put into a coma. In an apocalyptic gang fighting game, being taken 
out of the action means being killed. When a character is taken out of 
the action, they're no longer playable - either they're dead or they're the 
functional equivalent of being dead. If the character was a PC, the player 
should create a new character.




> In Vx's game, Brink (the Driver) decides to run over a thug who's trying 
> to guard the road. He rolls Hard, and gets a 10. The MC says, "Great. 
> You definitely hit this guy and hear a thump underneath the car. A car 
> going at this speed is definitely worth 2 harm, so he's either dead or 
> near death. The road's clear. What do you do next?" 

## Bonus to Carry Forward

Sometimes, succeeding on a Taking Action roll means that the PC is set 
up for future successes. In these cases, the MC can award a +1 bonus that 
the PC can apply to their next roll. The player should mark that bonus on 
their character sheet.

> In Courtney's game, Helena (the Hawk Caller) sends her hawks out to 
> scout for the best place to try to sneak across the fortress walls. That's 
> a Taking Action roll, and Helena gets a 7-9. The MC says, "Alright, 
> your hawks sweep over the fortress, but they draw the suspicions of the 
> guards. If you press forward, you'll be encountering guards who are 
> armed and ready for you. But the hawks do identify the best place for 
> you to try to scale the walls - down by the thicket, where the wall has 
> begun to crumble. You'll carry a +1 bonus forward to scaling the wall 
> there, if you choose to." 

## Marking XP

Whenever you roll a highlighted stat you earn a point of XP. Mark it on 
the XP section of your sheet. When you hit 5 XP, erase all of it and take a 
new Player Move. If you've already got at least one move that references 
each of your specialities, you may create a new specialty and reference it 
in the Player Move you purchase.

## Between Sessions

At the end of each session, players may be asked to adjust relationship 
stats (if that's how relationship stats fluctuate in your game). Between 
sessions, the MC might create Dangers, and might link those Dangers 
into Bigger Pictures. At the start of each session, highlighted stats are 
changed. Whoever has the highest relationship score with a character 
chooses a stat to highlight, and the MC highlights a second stat.

## Dangers & the Bigger Picture

Between sessions, or even during them, the MC can create Dangers. 
Dangers are things that might cause problems for the PCs, or fight them 
for resources, or block the PCs on their path. When you create a Danger, 
take an index card. Write its name, and its Ambition, and 1-3 MC Moves. 
Its Ambition is whatever this thing wants and strives for. If the PCs don't 
do anything about the Danger, the Ambition will either happen or it'll be 
attempted and disastrous effects will result. The MC Moves are things that 
the MC can add to their list of MC Moves whenever the Danger is afoot.

> In Vx's post-apocalyptic game, he creates a Danger called "Morken, the 
> Grotesque."  His Ambition is "Hoard all valuables in the rag wastes."  His 
> MC Moves are "Display the nature of the world it inhabits. Threaten 
> someone, directly or by implication. Steal something from someone."  
> Whenever Morken is in the scene, those three things are things that Vx 
> can do as MC Moves.

In Courtney's unicorn knights game, she creates a Danger called "The 
Swamps of Symmetry."  Its Ambition is "Eliminate all odd numbers and 
out-of-balance things."  Its MC Moves are "Corral people into a remote 
location. Obscure the way out. Attempt to swallow people alive." 




If you have a group of Dangers that work together or interlock, you 
can group them together into a Bigger Picture. Take an index card 
and fold it in half. Now it acts as a folder or hand that you can stick 
the related Dangers into. On the front of the folded index card, list the 
Bigger Picture's name. On the inside halves, list a new Principle and a 
Dark Future. The Principle is something that you should do whenever 
this Bigger Picture is involved in a scene. The Dark Future is a list of 
possibilities for what could happen if the PCs don't intervene and change 
this Bigger Picture.

> Vx decides that Morken isn't the only threat in the Rag Wastes. So 
> he creates a new Bigger Picture called "The Rag Wastes."  In it, 
> Vx sticks three interrelated Dangers: Morken the Grotesque; The Gang 
> of Thunder; Rag Wurms. He lists a new Principle for whenever the 
> PCs are interacting with the Rag Wastes: "Entice people with 
> dangerous opportunities."  As the Dark Future, Vx writes "The Rag 
> Wastes will expand, becoming a dangerous and impassible realm of 
> thieves and mutants." 

## Genre and MC Decisions

The MC will have to make a number of decisions before and during play. 
The MC Prep that comes before play (naming stats, modifying Agendas/
Principles/MC Moves, clarifying the relationship stat) involves a lot of 
decisions about genre and tone. More decisions along these lines will be 
made in play.

The MC will have to make judgment calls about what requires a Taking 
Action roll, and what is outright impossible in the genre. The MC should 
use their veto right judiciously and sparingly. If someone wants to take 
an action that subverts the genre, that's good! It's only when they want to 
take an action that is impossible or nonsensical for a given genre that the 
MC should say that something isn't possible. When the MC says this, they 
should use the line, "I don't think that's possible, but you could instead 
[make some other interesting choice], if you'd like." 

When someone has all of the sections on their harm clock filled in, they 
are taken out of the action. What this means is dependent on genre and 
context. In a fighting adventure game, this will typically mean that they 
are killed or captured by fierce antagonistic forces. The MC should not 
pull their punches when they take someone out of the action! It should be 
done in the most dramatic and severe and permanent manner that makes 
sense for the genre and context.
