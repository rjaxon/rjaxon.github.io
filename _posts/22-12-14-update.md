I am going back to the basics with first principles. 

I've dug up my old college books and re-reading Operating Systems and Networking.

The text might be outdated, but it's been a blast revisiting my past.

I've also been reading [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p "Elements of Computing")
